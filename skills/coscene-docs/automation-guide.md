# coScene Automation Guide

## Overview

The coScene automation system connects events to actions through triggers.
The execution model is: an event occurs → a trigger matches → an action
executes → outputs are processed. All action authoring and trigger
configuration happens in the platform UI — there is no CLI or API for
creating or editing action definitions or trigger conditions.

```
Event (file upload, collection complete, record change, cron, task change)
    ↓
Trigger (matches event against configured conditions)
    ↓
Action (executes container code or sends HTTP webhook)
    ↓
Output (record.patch.json creates/updates records, chaining further triggers)
```

## Action Anatomy

An action (动作) is the fundamental building block. Each action has:

- **Name** — human-readable identifier
- **Description** — purpose and behavior
- **Labels** — categorization tags for filtering
- **Parameters** — key-value pairs, referenced as `{{parameter.key}}` in
  commands and bodies
- **Steps** — one or more execution steps (container or webhook)

### Parameter Interpolation

Double-brace syntax: `{{parameter.key}}`. Define key `input` with value
`hello world`, reference as `{{parameter.input}}` — platform substitutes at
invocation time. Parameters are project-scoped and reusable.

### Authoring Constraint

Actions are authored exclusively in the platform web UI — no cocli command or
API. System-provided built-in actions (e.g., "Decompress File") are available
without authoring.

## Container Code Execution (镜像代码执行)

### Image Sources

| Source | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Organization registry | `registry.example.com/org/image:tag` | Private images uploaded to org registry |
| Docker Hub | `python:3.11-slim` | Public images |
| Official coScene images | `registry-vpc.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/coscene/cos:2025-02-06-v25.6.1` | Internal images with `icos` tool pre-installed |

### Command Format

Commands use multi-line format with one parameter per line. This is a common
source of errors — each flag and argument goes on its own line.

**Correct:**
```
ls
-al
/cos/files
```

**Incorrect:**
```
ls -al /cos/files
```

The platform splits on newlines and passes each line as a separate argument to
the container entrypoint.

### Mount Points

Every container action automatically receives these mount points:

| Mount Path | Variable | Purpose | Permissions |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/cos/files` | `COS_FILE_VOLUME` | Record files (input) | Read-only or read-write (configurable) |
| `/cos/outputs` | `COS_OUTPUT_VOLUME` | Action outputs (auto-saved) | Read-write |
| `/cos/local_disk` | — | High-speed temporary storage | Read-write; cleared after execution |
| `/cos/codes` | `COS_CODE_VOLUME` | Code mount | Read-only |
| `/cos/bins` | `COS_BIN_VOLUME` | Binary files mount | Read-only |
| `/cos/bundles` | `COS_BUNDLE_VOLUME` | Batch test programs | Read-only |
| `/cos/artifacts` | `COS_ARTIFACT_VOLUME` | Batch test artifacts | Read-write |

**Output handling options:**

- Add output files to the existing record
- Replace record files with output files
- Both options auto-process `record.patch.json` in output directories

### Resource Options

| Tier | CPU | Memory | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Small | 1 core | 2 GB | Default for lightweight processing |
| Medium | 2 cores | 4 GB | General-purpose |
| Large | 4 cores | 8 GB | Data-intensive processing |
| XL | 8 cores | 16 GB | Heavy computation; contact support for higher |

Custom resource configurations are available by contacting coScene support.

## HTTP Webhook (HTTP 请求)

Webhooks send HTTP requests to external endpoints when triggered. Common uses
include notification integrations (DingTalk, Slack, custom alerting).

### Configuration

| Field | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Method | HTTP method | `POST`, `GET` |
| URL | Target endpoint | `https://hooks.slack.com/...` |
| Headers | Key-value pairs | `Content-Type: application/json` |
| Body | Request body (supports variable interpolation) | JSON payload with `{{task.title}}` |
| Timeout | Request timeout | 30 seconds (default) |

### Built-in Variables for Webhooks

These variables are automatically available in webhook URL, headers, and body:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `{{task.title}}` | Title of the associated task |
| `{{record.link}}` | Direct URL to the record in the web UI |
| `{{device.id}}` | Device identifier |
| `{{device.display_name}}` | Human-readable device name |
| `{{task.create_time}}` | Task creation timestamp |

## Runtime Environment Variables

The platform automatically injects these environment variables into every
container action execution:

### Volume Paths

| Variable | Default Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `COS_FILE_VOLUME` | `/cos/files` | Record files mount directory |
| `COS_OUTPUT_VOLUME` | `/cos/outputs` | Action output directory |
| `COS_CODE_VOLUME` | `/cos/codes` | Code mount directory |
| `COS_BIN_VOLUME` | `/cos/bins` | Binary files mount directory |
| `COS_BUNDLE_VOLUME` | `/cos/bundles` | Batch test program mount directory |
| `COS_ARTIFACT_VOLUME` | `/cos/artifacts` | Batch test artifact directory |

### Identity and Context

| Variable | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `COS_ORGID` | Organization ID (UUID) | Always set |
| `COS_USERID` | User ID (UUID) of the trigger initiator | Always set |
| `COS_WAREHOUSEID` | Warehouse ID | Always set |
| `COS_PROJECT` | Current project slug (human-readable) | Always set |
| `COS_PROJECTID` | Project ID (UUID) | Always set |
| `COS_RECORDID` | Record ID (UUID) | Set when action is record-scoped |

### Platform Access

| Variable | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `COS_ENDPOINT` | coScene API endpoint URL | `openapi.coscene.cn` or `openapi.coscene.io` |
| `COS_TOKEN` | Authentication token | See security note below |

### COS_TOKEN Security

`COS_TOKEN` is platform-injected, inherits full permissions of the trigger
initiator. Valid only for action lifetime. Never log to stdout/stderr (visible
in invocation history), never exfiltrate, never persist. Cross-project
operations require initiator access to target project — otherwise 403.

## Trigger Types

Five trigger types connect events to actions. All trigger configuration is
UI-only — no API for creating or modifying triggers.

### 1. File Upload (文件上传)

Fires when a file uploaded to a record matches configured conditions.

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Glob pattern | Filename pattern | `*.zip`, `*.mcap`, `data/*.bag` |
| Uploader filter | Who uploaded | Member, Device, or Any |
| Record label match | Required record labels | `["production", "error"]` |

Labels are evaluated at upload time. Changing labels on an existing record
does NOT retroactively fire this trigger.

### 2. Device Collection Status Change (设备采集状态变更)

Fires when a device completes data collection. Filter by status:
`manual_complete` or `rule_complete`.

### 3. Record Change (记录变更)

Fires when a record's label or custom field is modified (not file upload).
Label mutation and custom field mutation are separate match conditions.

### 4. Task Status Change (任务状态变更)

Fires when a task's status changes to a specified value (e.g., `"已处理"`,
`"已关闭"`).

### 5. Cron Schedule (定时触发)

Standard 5-field cron: `minute hour day_of_month month day_of_week`

| Expression | Schedule |
|---|---|
| `0 * * * *` | Hourly at :00 |
| `0 0 * * *` | Daily at midnight |
| `0 0 * * 0` | Weekly on Sunday |
| `0 3 1,15 * *` | 1st and 15th at 03:00 |
| `30 6 * * 5` | Every Friday at 06:30 |
| `*/15 * * * *` | Every 15 minutes |

Runs in UTC by default (configurable via environment settings).

## record.patch.json Convention

Actions create or update records by writing structured output to the
`$COS_OUTPUT_VOLUME/records/` directory. The platform automatically scans
this directory after action completion and processes each subdirectory.

### Directory Structure

```
$COS_OUTPUT_VOLUME/
└── records/
    ├── analysis-report/
    │   ├── summary.pdf
    │   ├── charts/
    │   │   ├── error-rate.png
    │   │   └── timeline.png
    │   └── .cos/
    │       └── record.patch.json
    └── extracted-frames/
        ├── frame-001.jpg
        ├── frame-002.jpg
        └── .cos/
            └── record.patch.json
```

Each subdirectory under `records/` becomes a record operation (create or
update). The `.cos/record.patch.json` file controls what happens.

### record.patch.json Schema

```json
{
  "projectSlug": "target-project",
  "id": "existing-record-uuid",
  "title": "Record Title",
  "description": "Human-readable description",
  "labels": ["label-1", "label-2"],
  "patch": [
    { "op": "replace", "path": "/title", "value": "New Title" },
    { "op": "add", "path": "/labels/-", "value": "new-label" },
    { "op": "remove", "path": "/labels/0" },
    { "op": "add", "path": "/files/path/to/file", "value": "../relative/path.jpg" }
  ]
}
```

### Operations

**Create:** Omit `id`, include `title` (required). All files in the subdirectory
are uploaded to the new record.

```json
{ "title": "Analysis Results", "labels": ["automated", "analysis"] }
```

**Update:** Include `id` (UUID), use `patch` array (RFC 6902 JSON Patch).

```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "patch": [
    { "op": "replace", "path": "/title", "value": "Updated Title" },
    { "op": "add", "path": "/labels/-", "value": "processed" }
  ]
}
```

**File references:** relative paths from record subdirectory — e.g.,
`{ "op": "add", "path": "/files/report.pdf", "value": "../report.pdf" }`

**Cross-project:** specify `projectSlug` to target a different project. The
`COS_TOKEN` initiator must have write access to that project.

### Automatic Processing

After action completion, the platform scans `$COS_OUTPUT_VOLUME/records/` for
subdirectories, reads `.cos/record.patch.json` in each, creates/patches records,
uploads files, and logs results to invocation history.

## Action Chaining

Chain actions by having Action A write `record.patch.json` to create a record
with specific labels, then a file upload trigger matching those labels fires
Action B on the new record.

```
Action A → writes record.patch.json (label: "stage-1") → platform creates record
    → file upload trigger (glob: *.csv, label: "stage-1") → Action B fires
```

**Design notes:**
- Use labels to distinguish pipeline stages and route to the correct next action
- No built-in pipeline orchestrator — chaining is emergent from trigger-action
- Circular chains are possible — use labels or naming conventions to break cycles
- Each action gets its own `COS_TOKEN` (inheriting original initiator perms)

## Best Practices

- **Deduplication:** always configure event deduplication windows to prevent
  duplicate data collection from rapid-fire events
- **Glob patterns:** be precise — `*.zip` not `*.zip*`; test patterns before
  deploying triggers
- **Labels for routing:** use labels in `record.patch.json` to control which
  triggers fire on action output; do not rely on label changes to re-trigger
  file-upload workflows
- **Cross-project access:** verify `COS_TOKEN` initiator has target project
  permissions before deploying cross-project `record.patch.json` operations
- **Output structure:** always follow the `records/*/` convention in
  `$COS_OUTPUT_VOLUME` with `.cos/record.patch.json` — the platform ignores
  output files that do not follow this structure for record operations
- **Resource sizing:** start with 2C/4G and scale up only if action execution
  hits OOM or timeout; over-provisioning wastes quota
- **Idempotency:** design actions to be re-runnable — use record `id` for
  updates to avoid creating duplicate records on retry
